# permutation_bootstrap
Often researchers get excited about discovering statistically significant findings without full comprehension of its meaning. It is a phrase that is loaded with meaning, yet often itâ€™s hard to explain and harder to understand. Traditionally we set up a null hypothesis (H_0) and an alternative hypothesis (H_1) and by using statistical significant test we try to reject the null hypothesis. 
To help in explaining the concept of statistical significant the app illustrates how easy it may be for a difference between the two samples to occur purely by chance. Without focusing on hypothesis testing and calculation of some other statistic like a t-ratio, using two-sample permutation bootstrapping the attention could be given to the actual statistic of interest, ie. the difference between the two samples and its null distribution. 
This shiny app enables easy visualisation of null distribution and p-value making, often perceived as a complex procedure of hypothesis testing, very natural.
